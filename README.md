# Event-Driven Data Stream Architecture

This document outlines the architecture for an event-driven application that uses a data streaming platform (Kafka or Kinesis) as the single source of truth.

## Architecture Overview

Our architecture follows an event-driven design pattern where all data flows through a central streaming platform. This approach provides:

1. **Decoupling** - Services communicate asynchronously without direct dependencies
2. **Resilience** - Systems can recover from failures by replaying events
3. **Scalability** - Components can scale independently
4. **Consistency** - Single source of truth for all data

## System Components

### 1. Data Streaming Platform
- **Options**: Apache Kafka or Amazon Kinesis
- **Role**: Central event bus and source of truth
- **Features**: Durability, ordering, replay capability, partitioning

### 2. Producers
- **Data Sources**: User applications, IoT devices, system events, etc.
- **Responsibility**: Generate events and publish to the stream

### 3. Consumers
- **Databases**: Multiple purpose-specific databases (RDBMS, NoSQL, etc.)
- **Services**: Microservices that process events and take actions
- **Analytics**: Real-time and batch processing systems

### 4. Schema Registry
- **Purpose**: Maintain event schema definitions
- **Benefits**: Ensures compatibility, enables evolution
- **Implementation**: AWS Glue Schema Registry (see [schema-registry-setup.md](schema-registry-setup.md))

### 5. Stream Processing
- **Purpose**: Transform, enrich, aggregate stream data
- **Technologies**: Kafka Streams, KSQLdb, Kinesis Data Analytics

## Data Flow

1. Producers publish events to the stream
2. Events are persisted in the stream with a retention policy
3. Consumers process events in real-time or batch
4. Databases maintain materialized views of the stream data
5. Services react to events and may produce new events

## Recovery Patterns

### Database Recovery
In case of database corruption or failure:
1. Clear affected database
2. Replay events from the stream from a specific offset
3. Rebuild database state

### Service Recovery
When a service fails or needs to be redeployed:
1. Service restarts and connects to the stream
2. Reads from last committed offset or specified point
3. Processes events to catch up to current state

## Implementation Comparison

### Apache Kafka Option

#### Pros:
- Open-source with large community
- Longer retention capabilities
- Rich ecosystem (Kafka Connect, Streams, KSQL)
- Self-hosted control

#### Cons:
- Operational complexity
- Requires cluster management
- More configuration options to tune

### Amazon Kinesis Option

#### Pros:
- Fully managed AWS service
- Seamless integration with AWS ecosystem
- Simplified operations
- Pay-as-you-go pricing

#### Cons:
- Limited retention (up to 7 days)
- Throughput limitations per shard
- Less flexible than Kafka for complex scenarios

## Deployment Considerations

### Kafka Deployment
- Kafka brokers (3+ for high availability)
- ZooKeeper ensemble (or KRaft mode for newer versions)
- Schema Registry
- Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)

### Kinesis Deployment
- Kinesis Data Streams
- Kinesis Data Analytics
- AWS Glue Schema Registry
- CloudWatch monitoring

## Security Considerations

- Authentication and authorization
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Audit logging
- Access control policies

## Monitoring and Observability

- Stream lag monitoring
- Consumer group offsets
- Throughput and latency metrics
- Error rates and dead-letter queues

## Implementation Progress

1. ✅ Set up AWS Glue Schema Registry
2. ✅ Define initial event schemas (user-activity, product-event)
3. ⬜ Set up Kinesis Data Streams
4. ⬜ Implement producer applications
5. ⬜ Implement consumer services
6. ⬜ Configure monitoring and alerting
7. ⬜ Develop recovery procedures
